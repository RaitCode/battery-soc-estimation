Battery State of Charge (SoC) Estimation and Visualization

This project performs **State of Charge (SoC) estimation** of a battery using real current-time data from an eVTOL battery dataset. The estimation is done by numerically integrating the current over time â€” a technique commonly referred to as **Coulomb Counting**.

The output is a combined plot showing:
- SoC during **charging** and **discharging** phases
- Corresponding **current profile** over time

## Plot Interpretation

- **Green Line (Charging SoC)**: The SOC begins at 0% and increases almost linearly during charging, reflecting a steady positive current (~1.5 A). The SOC reaches nearly 100%, indicating full charge.
- **Blue Line (Current)**: The charging process begins with a relatively high and stable current (~1.5 A), characteristic of a Constant Current (CC) phase. Around 90% State of Charge (SoC), the current begins to drop gradually. This drop likely indicates a transition to a Constant Voltage (CV) phase â€” a typical behavior in lithium-ion battery charging, where the voltage is held steady and the current tapers off as the battery nears full charge. While the voltage data isnâ€™t shown here, the current profile suggests that such a transition may have occurred. Following a short resting phase, the current turns negative, marking the beginning of the discharge phase, which appears to proceed at a relatively constant current draw (~ -0.6 A).
- **Red Line (Discharging SoC)**: After charging completes, SoC begins to decrease linearly, driven by a relatively constant negative current (~ -0.6 A). The SOC falls from 100% down to nearly 0% as the battery discharges.
- The sharp drop in current during the transition from charge to discharge, and the consistency of the current during both phases, illustrate a well-controlled test environment.
